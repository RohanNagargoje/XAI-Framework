XAI Framework for Common ML Models 

This project aims to build an Explainable AI (XAI) Framework that provides easy-to-use tools for explaining common machine learning models like Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Neural Networks. The framework integrates multiple explainability techniques (e.g., SHAP, LIME, Feature Importance) to help data scientists, machine learning practitioners, and AI enthusiasts understand the predictions of these models in a transparent and interpretable manner.

Key Features
- Model Training: Support for training and evaluating basic machine learning models (Decision Trees, SVM, Neural Networks) on standard datasets.
- Explainability Techniques: Integration with popular XAI methods like SHAP and LIME for explaining model predictions.
- Visualization Tools: Provides visual representations of model explanations (e.g., feature importance plots, SHAP value plots, LIME explanations).
- Modular Architecture: Easily extendable to add new models or explanation techniques.
- Educational Resource: Detailed documentation and Jupyter notebooks that help beginners understand the framework and how to use it.

Goals
- Interpretability: Make machine learning models more interpretable and accessible to a wider audience.
- Explainability: Simplify the process of explaining model predictions using popular explainability methods.
- Visual Understanding: Provide clear and easy-to-understand visualizations to help users grasp how and why a model makes its decisions.
- Open Source: Create an open-source tool that can be extended and customized for various AI model explainability use cases.

Technologies Used
- Python: Core language for implementation.
- Scikit-learn: For training models (Decision Trees, SVMs, Neural Networks).
- SHAP: For model explainability using SHAP values.
- LIME: For local, interpretable model-agnostic explanations.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizations.
- Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and handling.
- Jupyter Notebooks: For interactive demonstrations of the framework.

Usage Example

1. Train a Model
Select and train a machine learning model (e.g., Decision Tree) using a dataset.

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load dataset
data = load_iris()
X, y = data.data, data.target

# Train model
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)
```

2. Generate Explanations
Use SHAP or LIME to generate model explanations and understand which features influence predictions.

```python
import shap

# Create SHAP explainer
explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X)

# Visualize SHAP values
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X)
```

3. Visualize Results
Display feature importance and other model insights through intuitive visualizations.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.barplot(x=shap_values[0], y=data.feature_names)
plt.show()
```
