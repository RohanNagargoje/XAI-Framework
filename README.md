### XAI Framework for Common ML Models

#### Overview
The **Explainable AI (XAI) Framework** is designed to simplify the process of explaining and understanding machine learning models. It provides user-friendly tools for explaining popular models like **Decision Trees**, **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**, and **Neural Networks**. By integrating state-of-the-art explainability techniques such as **SHAP**, **LIME**, and **Feature Importance**, the framework helps data scientists, machine learning practitioners, and AI enthusiasts make model predictions more transparent and interpretable.

### Key Features

1. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   - Train and evaluate common machine learning models like Decision Trees, SVMs, and Neural Networks.
   - Support for loading and working with standard datasets (e.g., Iris, Wine, Boston Housing).

2. **Explainability Techniques**
   - **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):** Understand feature contributions at both global and local levels.
   - **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations):** Generate localized explanations for individual predictions.
   - **Feature Importance:** Visualize and rank features based on their contribution to the model’s predictions.

3. **Visualization Tools**
   - Generate interactive and static visualizations for model explanations:
     - SHAP Summary and Dependence Plots
     - LIME Explanations
     - Feature Importance Bar Charts

4. **Modular Architecture**
   - Easily extendable to add new models or explainability techniques without altering the core framework.

5. **Educational Resource**
   - Includes detailed documentation and interactive **Jupyter Notebooks** to guide beginners in understanding explainability concepts and using the framework.

### Goals

1. **Interpretability:** Simplify machine learning models and make them accessible to a wider audience.
2. **Explainability:** Enable users to easily explain model predictions using reliable tools.
3. **Visual Understanding:** Provide intuitive visualizations to convey complex model behaviors effectively.
4. **Open Source:** Build an extensible, community-driven project for AI explainability.

### Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core language for implementation.
- **Scikit-learn:** Model training and evaluation.
- **SHAP:** Feature attribution for explainability.
- **LIME:** Model-agnostic local explanations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For clear and aesthetic visualizations.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** Data manipulation and processing.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Interactive demonstrations and tutorials.

### Usage Guide

#### 1. Train a Model
Choose a machine learning model and train it on your dataset.

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load dataset
data = load_iris()
X, y = data.data, data.target

# Train model
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)
```

#### 2. Generate Explanations
Leverage SHAP or LIME to understand model behavior and feature contributions.

**Using SHAP:**
```python
import shap

# Create SHAP explainer
explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X)

# Visualize SHAP values
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X, feature_names=data.feature_names)
```

**Using LIME:**
```python
from lime.lime_tabular import LimeTabularExplainer

# Create LIME explainer
explainer = LimeTabularExplainer(X, feature_names=data.feature_names, class_names=data.target_names, discretize_continuous=True)

# Explain a prediction
exp = explainer.explain_instance(X[0], model.predict_proba, num_features=3)
exp.show_in_notebook()
```

#### 3. Visualize Results
Create insightful visualizations for feature importance and explanations.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example: Feature importance using SHAP values
sns.barplot(x=shap_values[0].mean(axis=0), y=data.feature_names)
plt.title("Feature Importance")
plt.show()
```
